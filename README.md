# About
Payroll-Org is fictional organisation with 1000 employees based in UK/NIE. Recently, HR has been receiving numerous annonymous emails stating that there is a lot of discrimination within the organisation and specifically related to the **Salary**. The email has caught the HR head's eyes as any form of discrimination is against company's policies and values. Moreover, if this is found to be true then the company is violating UK's **The Equality Act 2010**  and **The Equal Pay Act 1970**. The HR head has requested the analyst team to identify the indicators of discrimination within the organisation, so, the problem can be triaged and resolved.

## My Journal
- The organisation is fictional and does not have data related to its employees. 
- To generate this data I created a Python script that uses Faker library to generate random data and Openpyxl library to populate the Excel Workbook.
- Once the Excel Workbook [Payroll Data](/payroll-data.xlsx) is poppulated, I selected indicators that could help me to solve the problem.
- I used tools such as remove duplicates, functions, conditional functions, etc to clean the data.
- Then I used pivot tables, data slicer, and graphs to create the visual dashboard.
- I have documented the data cleaning and analysis process in the [Data Analyst](/Data%20analyst.pptx).
